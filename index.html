            Is your code not working? That is very normal, especially when you
            are first starting. Keep at it! And you can work through any of
            the challenges you face on this “assignment”.

            <h3>"Learn Karel Basics" not marked complete</h3>
            <p>
              The step involving reading chapters 1-5 doesn't get marked as complete with a green tick like the other steps. Feel free to read at your own pace and move on from this step when you finish the chapters.

              Troubleshooting steps: 
            </p>

              <ol>
                <li> Navigate to the <a href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/announcement/">Code in Place homepage</a>,
                  reopen the application form and try to sign in again. </li>
                <li> Are you using a phone? Try logging in from a computer instead. </li>
                <li> Try out any other email you might have signed up with. </li>
                <li>Try both the "Sign up with email" and the "Sign in with google" buttons. Depending on whether you originally
                  selected "Sign up with email" or "Sign up with google", there are some cases where trying to login with the opposite
                  method will cause problems. </li>
                <li> If all else fails: send us an email with screenshots/details about your problem. We'll do everything we can to make
                  sure you don't lose any progress.</li>

            <h3>Have you received my application?</h3>
            <p>
              Sign into your student application and look for the green status bar at the top of the application. If it says "Application complete! You finished...", then we have successfully received your application! If your application isn’t complete, that status bar will show what your next steps are.

          <h2>Understanding Typos</h2>
          <p>
            Reading error messages for typos is a skill that is worth learning
            but takes some practice. Here is a translation of some of the common
            ones and what they could mean.
          </p>
          
          <div class="card question" >
            <h3><code>Expected a body definition</code></h3>
            <p>
              All functions (like <code>main</code>) need to have a body, which is
              the indented code. See Chapter 3 of the Karel Reader. For example,
              in this <code>turn_right</code> function definition, the
              <code>turn_left</code> commands are all in the body:
            </p>
            
            <pre>
              def turn_right():
              turn_left()
              turn_left()
              turn_left()</pre>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card question">
              <h3><code>Function body must be indented…</code></h3>
              <p>
                All functions (like main) need to have a body, which is the indented
                code. See Chapter 3 of the Karel Reader. If you don’t have any code
                in the function body, that can lead to this error.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card question" >
              <h3><code>Found a new-line when expecting ":"</code></h3>
              <p>
                If you are defining a new function, or a for loop, you need to end
                the header with a <code>:</code>.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card question" >
              <h3><code>Found "&lt;something&gt;" when expecting "("</code></h3>
              <p>There are several issues that can cause this message.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Every command has open and closed parentheses after it. So for
                  example we write <code>move()</code>, not <code>move</code>.
                  Similarly, when you define a function, you also write open and
                  closed parentheses after the name. You will learn why we do this
                  in a few weeks!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    This can happen if you try and declare a function inside another
                    function. In Karel, that is not allowed. Recall that there is a
                    difference between defining a new function and using one:
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <pre>
                def main():
                move()
                def illegal_nested_function():
                turn_left()</pre>
              </div>
              
              <div class="card question" >
                <h3><code>Found move when expecting def</code></h3>
                <p>
                  In Karel, all commands must be declared inside a function! Do you
                  have a
                  <code>main</code> function?
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-section">
              <h2>Warmup</h2>

              <h2>Shelter-in-place</h2>
              
              <div class="card question">
                <h3>It's not being marked as complete.</h3>
                <p>
                  Whenever a Karel program isn’t being marked as complete when you think it should be, immediately see if any error messages are popping up below the Karel window. If this is the case check out the “Understanding Typos” section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If it isn’t an error message, reread the exercise requirements. A common mistake with “Shelter-in-place” is returning the beeper to the starting point instead of just returning Karel to its starting point. To clarify- we don't want any beepers present in the world after our code runs for this problem.
                </p>

                <h3>My for loop won't stop</h3>
                <p>
                  The number after <code>range(</code> is the number of times the indented code underneath the for loop runs. In this case our <code>#code`</code> repeats 11 times. If you would like the for loop to end earlier, you can decrease this number. While there are other ways to stop a loop, this is the best strategy to do so for this problem. Check out chapter 5 for more information!

                <pre>
                  for i in range(11):
                  #code
                </pre>
